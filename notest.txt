Database =>
    Collection of data in a format that can easily accessible.

    A software application that is used to manage our database is called a (Database Management System).


    user => DBMS => Database

    Types of Database;
    Relational Database                  Non-Relational Database

    1. Data stored in tables,            2.Data stored in some other forms




    we use SQL to use work with relational DBMS
    RDBMS =>  MySQL

    eg: PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, 


SQL = Structured Query Language.
SQL is a programming language that is used to interact with the relational database.


Its used to perform CRUD operations

1.Create  => table schema design
2.Read
3.Update
4.Delete

<============== CREATING A DATABASE ==============>

      Create Database database_name 
                     OR
     CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS database_name ✅

<============== DELETING   A DATABASE ==============>

         Drop Database database_name 
                    OR
    DROP DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS database_name ✅



 After creating DB then use this query before creating tables 

   =>    "User database_name;"


Lets Design tables
===> How to create a table?

CREATE TABLE table_name(
    column_name1 datatype constraint,
    column_name2 datatype constraint,
    column_name3 datatype constraint,
)


How to delete a table?
  DROP TABLE table_name;

to see table structure? 
 DESCRIBE table_name;

to add a new column?

  ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name data_type constraint;


to delete a new column?
  ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;

   
    
to insert values 

INSERT INTO   table_name VALUES(
    value1, value2, value3
);


To show all the data in the Table
 SELECT * FROM table_name;

SQL DATATYPES


signed and Unsigned 
TININT UNSIGNED(0 TO 255)
TINYINT (-128 to 127)


TYPES OF SQL COMMANDS:

1. Data Definition Language (DDL) 😎
    CREATE, ALTER, RENAME, DROP, TRUNCATE, 

2. Data Query Language (DQL) 😊
    SELECT

3. Data Manipulation Language (DML) 🙃
    INSERT, UPDATE , DELETE

4. Data Control Language (DCL)
    GRANT & REVOKE

5. Transaction Control Language(TCL)
    start Transaction, COMMIT, ROLLBACK

Primary Key🔑
  => Its a column  ( or a set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row.
 
  => There is only 1️⃣ Primary Key and Its should not be NOT NULL.

  UNIQUE, NOT NULL


Foreign Key🗝️

 => foreign key is a column in a table that refers to the primary in another table.

 => There can be Multiple foreign keys in a table.

 => Foreign key can have duplicate and null values.

Constraints 📏 
  =>  Constraints are used to specify some rule to the data in a table.

  1. NOT NULL

      => Columns cannot have null values.
     syn:  column_name datatype NOT NULL

  2. UNIQUE 

     => All values in a column are different. 
     syn: column_name datatype UNIQUE

  3. PRIMARY KEY
     => column that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
    syn: column_name datatype PRIMARY KEY

    OR 

    PRIMARY KEY(column_name)


    eg: 
    CREATE TABLE dummy(
        id INT,
        name VARCHAR(34) NOT NULL,
        age INT NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (id)
    )

    or 

    CREATE TABLE dummy(
        id INT NOT NULL,
        aname VARCHAR(34) NOT NULL,
        age INT NOT NULL,
    )
