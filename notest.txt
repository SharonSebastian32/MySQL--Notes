Database =>
    Collection of data in a format that can easily accessible.

    A software application that is used to manage our database is called a (Database Management System).


    user => DBMS => Database

    Types of Database;
    Relational Database                  Non-Relational Database

    1. Data stored in tables,            2.Data stored in some other forms




    we use SQL to use work with relational DBMS
    RDBMS =>  MySQL

    eg: PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, 


SQL = Structured Query Language.
SQL is a programming language that is used to interact with the relational database.


Its used to perform CRUD operations

1.Create  => table schema design
2.Read
3.Update
4.Delete


SEQUEL= Structured English Query Language. //IBM
SQL = Structured Query Language
 

 Database related Querries✅


<============== CREATING A DATABASE ==============>

      Create Database database_name 
                     OR
     CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS database_name ✅

<============== DELETING   A DATABASE ==============>

         Drop Database database_name 
                    OR
    DROP DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS database_name ✅



 After creating DB then use this query before creating tables 

   =>    "User database_name;"


Lets Design tables
===> How to create a table?

CREATE TABLE table_name(
    column_name1 datatype constraint,
    column_name2 datatype constraint,
    column_name3 datatype constraint,
)


How to delete a table?
  DROP TABLE table_name;

to see table structure? 
 DESCRIBE table_name;

to add a new column?

  ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name data_type constraint;


to delete a new column?
  ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;

   
    
to insert values 

INSERT INTO   table_name VALUES(
    value1, value2, value3
);

to update a vaule or a data inside a TABLE ?
ans ===> use this command 
UPDATE table_name SET  column_name = value WHERE condition 



To show all the data in the Table
 SELECT * FROM table_name;



SQL DATATYPES


signed and Unsigned 
TININT UNSIGNED(0 TO 255)
TINYINT (-128 to 127)


TYPES OF SQL COMMANDS:

1. Data Definition Language (DDL) 😎
    CREATE, ALTER, RENAME, DROP, TRUNCATE, 

2. Data Query Language (DQL) 😊
    SELECT

3. Data Manipulation Language (DML) 🙃
    INSERT, UPDATE , DELETE

4. Data Control Language (DCL)
    GRANT & REVOKE

5. Transaction Control Language(TCL)
    start Transaction, COMMIT, ROLLBACK


* =====> arteristic key, in sql this key indicate " all " 
  

  <=========== 10/19/2024 =============>





Primary Key🔑
  => Its a column  ( or a set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row.
 
  => There is only 1️⃣ Primary Key and Its should not be NOT NULL.

  UNIQUE, NOT NULL


Foreign Key🗝️

 => foreign key is a column in a table that refers to the primary in another table.

 => There can be Multiple foreign keys in a table.

 => Foreign key can have duplicate and null values.

Constraints 📏 
  =>  Constraints are used to specify some rule to the data in a table.

  1. NOT NULL

    => Columns cannot have null values.
    syn:  column_name datatype NOT NULL

  2. UNIQUE 

    => All values in a column are different. 
    syn: column_name datatype UNIQUE

  3. PRIMARY KEY
    => column that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
    syn: column_name datatype PRIMARY KEY

    OR 

    PRIMARY KEY(column_name)

    eg: 
    CREATE TABLE dummy(
        id INT,
        name VARCHAR(34) NOT NULL,
        age INT NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (id)
    )

    or 

    CREATE TABLE dummy(
        id INT NOT NULL,
        aname VARCHAR(34) NOT NULL,
        age INT NOT NULL,
    )

 

   4.Foreign Key
    Prevent action  that would destroy the links between the tAbles.


   syn:  CREATE TABLE temp(
    cust_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES Customers(id)
   )



  ==> temp is a table and cust_id is the Primary key of the TABLE temp.
  ==>  Customers is another  table and id is the primary key of the  TABLE Customers which is a foreign key of table temp.




  5. DEFAULT 
    ==> set the default value of the column.


    default constraint for a column 
    syn : salay INT DEFAULT 2000;

  6. CHECK

    ==>  it can Limit values allowed in a column
    syn: age iNT  CHECK (age >= 18);
  7. 







SELECT 
 



1. find the name of student who is from mumbai have marks greater than 90.


1. find the name of student who is from Delhi have marks greater than 90.


WE CAN RETRIEVE aANY DATA FORM student table using SQL 
SEQUEL 

 ==> DISTINCT  retrieve unique data



===> SELECT with WHERE CLAUSE
 For adding two condition with WHERE clause use & OPERATOR && 


USING OPERATORS IN WHERE clause  
  1. Arithmetical Operator,

    (addition +),
    (multiplication *),
    (division /),
    (subtraction  -),
    (modulus %),



  2. Comparison Operator,

     = (equal to),
     != (not equal),
     > (greater than),
     < (less than),
     >= (greater than or equal to),
     <= (less than or equal to)

  3. Logical Operator,

       AND,
       OR,
       NOT,
       IN,
      BETWEEN,
      LIKE,
      ALL,
      ANY


  4. Bitwise Operator,


     & (Bitwise AND),
     | (Bitwise OR)  


   5. LIMIT 3 => limit the result to three.

   imp

   6. ORDER BY clause
     ASC => Ascending order (low to high)
     DESC => Descending order( high to low)
   
 
Aggregate Functions

  Aggregate function performs a calculation on a set of values , and returns a single value.

   1. COUNT(),
   2. MAX(),
   3. MIN(),
   4. SUM(),
   5. AVG(),

 Group by clause
